# WAF-Data-Challenge

Attached in this project is my work for the WAF Fall 2022 Data Challenge. The objective was to analyze an Inside Airbnb dataset. This project is the first time I have used Jupyter Notebook for something of this scale, and also virtually my first time using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sk-learn, etc. Thank you for stopping by and checking this out!
